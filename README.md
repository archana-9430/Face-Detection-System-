# Face-Detection-System-
This is a face detection system for serving food in hospital and hostel messes, ashrams and old homages. 
This system will ensure the one attendee can have at max one meal at a time. 
Also, it will help us keep a record of attendees who have received the meal. Moreover, the attendees can give the order for the next day meal.
